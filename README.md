# Python static json server
## What is it?
This is (will be) a simple service that allows you to serve static json or yaml files. <br>

It will have preprocessing of given json to check if they do not contain mistakes. <br>

The preprocessing will replace JSON fields named 'text' from array to single multiline string.  <br>

The service should be configurable and allow simple token/jwt or certificate based authentication.
